There are two files. Node.java and SSSPDriver.java

The SSSPDriver.java is the file with main class, mapper and reducer.

The node.java is file for creating nodes.

To run the program provide Input path where the input file is placed and output path.

If you are running it directly from eclipes provide these paths as arguments in Run configurations.

All intermediate Outputs will be generated in separate output folders at the provided OUTPUT path. 

The name of the cutomized partitioner is SSSPPartitioner. The logic I implemented in partitioner is:
if key is between 1 to 33  reducer 0
if key is between 34 to 66 reducer 1
if key is between 67 to 100 reducer2 
Partitioner dived the input file in three parts.

Number of reduce task is set to 3.
