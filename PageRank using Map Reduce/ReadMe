The input is in the following format
PageNo:Rank outlinks
Ex 1:.5	2,3,4

When input is read by mapper it creates the intermediate output and sends it to reducer. 
There is only one mapper and one reducer for this project.

I am calculating the value of epsilon and checking if its <0.05 or not.
If its greater then run the project again. 

the name of data file is data.txt
For every iteration one output folder gets created as output1 , output2 and so on
